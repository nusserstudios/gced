        tools and gadgets, that make me a Swiss Army Knife.</h1>
    <p class="mt-8 text-lg text-zinc-600 dark:text-gray-400">I often get asked about the tools, apps, and
        services I use to succeed in my work. Here’s a list of my favorite tools that I use daily. They’ve helped me
        build a successful business and would also be a great addition to anyone’s arsenal.</p>

                                Nvidia 3090 Ultra Ti video card for video editing and AI art generation. It also has
                                enough memory for multi-tasking, fast transfer rates to a 4X, 4TB SSD NVMe storage,
                                and enough power to run multiple Adobe Creative Cloud products, and with VS Code

                                video quickly, just because I have more real estate and allow for multi-tasking from
                                running multiple applications simultaneously. I usually have my timeline on one
                                monitor and my video preview on another. I also use tools like NEXT.JS, which lets
                                me run VS Code on one monitor while my browser is live-reloading my coding changes.
                                OBS also comes in handy for recording time lapses and content for how-to videos.</p>

                                bit as good as a Wacom, perhaps, even better. You cant see the price point. I use
                                this for digital drawing and painting. It is also a fantastic asset to utilize for
                                photo retouching and editing. I highly recommend trying it out if you use a tablet.
                                When I was on a Mac, I used Sequal Pro.</p>

                                you could want. VS Code integrates with CLI on windows, Linux, or Mac and lets you
                                easily sync your settings, plugins, extensions, and git between multiple
                                devices—look no further than VS Code. It is open source and free and has many themes
                                for every dev. Especially dark mode, so my retinas won't get burned out while coding
                                for long periods. It lets you view the SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) exported from
                                Illustrator or Inkscape, which is excellent.</p>

                                due to the creative tools I use. The best part is that I can install multiple Linux
                                distributions on the WSL. Various Linux distributions, where specific needs come in
                                handy for handling different distributions for specialized tasks. Regarding using
                                Root Trellis, I can install WSL version 1 to control VirtualBox and Vagrant with one
                                workspace within VS Code, and I can use the latest version of Ubuntu to run Static

                                collaboration, and distribution of software development projects. It has an
                                easy-to-use interface accessible to novice coders and provides an alternative to
                                command-line version control systems. Since the entire codebase is available on
                                every developer's computer, branching and merging are much more accessible than
                                traditional software development tools. Honestly, I prefer to use Git the
                                old-fashioned way. In my opinion, the CLI is still one of the most underrated tools.
