This was some work that I did for a hunting a fishing retreat, while I was a Digital Art Director at Associated Integrated Marketing. Turned out very well. I really did try to push for a concept and the star showing the end of shells turned out fantastic. It never did get printed or ran, but I kept this project, because it showcases great art and copy.
