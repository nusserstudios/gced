When I was contacted by Boy in the Corner Studios A.K.A the “Toy
Assassin” Heath Duntz, and I was ecstatic. I've been collecting custom
made toys for years, but honestly… I had a hard time containing my
excitement.

Heath Duntz has been on the custom toy scene for a while now, and I
wanted to give him a brand that reflected his style of work. I cracked
down immediately and used some of the elements he had already started
utilizing himself. This logo is one of his trademark casts that he
does limited runs of.

"Deadboy" is his signature, and I utilized elements from his toys and
gave the logo and the type treatment something that you'd see out of a
freak show carnival. Follow him on Instagram, and if you like his
work, then buy a few pieces. You'll rest well knowing that you're
supporting an awesome artist, and a great human being.
