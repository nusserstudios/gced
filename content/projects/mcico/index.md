Mid-Continent Instruments and Avionics has been an industry leader in the overhaul, exchange, repair, design, and manufacturing of aircraft instruments, avionics, and advanced power solutions for over half a century.

Mid-Continent Instrument Company designs, develop, and manufactures electronic instruments for the aviation industry. Producing print collateral and point-of-sale items for tradeshows, fliers, brochures, and manuals was a big part of the daily workflow. I did a ton of digital marketing, including promotional email campaigns, social media artwork, and still and video production work.

True Blue Power is also a branch of Mid-Continent Instrument Co. that focuses on lithium batteries for aircraft and power solutions that include USB ports that are implemented in new and existing aircraft builds.

Mid-Continent Instruments, Avionics, and True Blue Power's products are integrated by the world's largest aircraft brands, like Beechcraft, Cessna, Cirrus, Daher, Diamond, Piper, Vulcanair, Airbus Helicopter, Bell, Enstrom Helicopter, MD Helicopters, Robinson Helicopter, and many others.
