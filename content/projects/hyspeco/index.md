Hyspeco is a Parker Hannifin distributor for hydraulics, pneumatics, industrial hose and fittings, industrial tools, industrial lifting equipment, and custom-designed engineering solutions. Hyspecos stocked inventory includes a wide selection of hydraulic products, including cylinders, valves, pumps, motors, and components.

Whether you need a simple hydraulic hose or fittings for a complex system, Hyspeco can deliver prepackaged options, or the engineering department could create custom engineering solutions for clients with
companies of all sizes. Customers and services a wide range of businesses with heavy-duty industrial machines. 

During my tenure as the Marketing Specialist, I oversaw revamping the website, managing and curating social media posts, and managing the company's video and photography projects. I moved the company from
MailChimp to Sendy for targeted email campaigns. Utilizing Amazons Simple Email Services, I reduced the cost of email campaigns by 80% by implementing Sendy (a self-hosted email/newsletter) service. They were paying approximately $2000/year on MailChimp, and by switching to Sendy, I brought that down to less than $100/year and quadrupled the number of marketing emails we were sending out.

Revamping the company's catalog and outside sales literature was also a significant part of my duties at Hyspeco. I implemented and built the brand standards to guide how the brand communicates with internal and external communications. Hyspeco fully integrated and utilized an extensive array of services from Amazon Web Hosting (AWS).
