## OctoMob OG Collection

OctoMob is an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) project for which I created the art on the Ethereum Blockchain. The first collection was a hand-drawn collection of 99 custom-made NFTs, sold at auction and individually on the Ethereum Blockchain. The (OG Collection) pieces sold for the starting price of 2 Ethereum each. Each person who bought a custom received a "Made Man" role on the Discord server.

I built everything from the website, branding, and marketing to the icons (static and animated) for the Discord server. I also produced the looping animations for Twitter and other social media channels. I also created the Mob Ties logo for OctoMob's weekly podcast.

## Hitmen Collection

The second collection was a generated collection of 999 nfts, called the Hitmen. These are animated gifs that continuously loop. This collection also has traits that allow for rarities, allowing collectors to attain sought-after, rare items. At this time in NFT collections, the more rare, the higher the valuation in Ethereum (Price).
