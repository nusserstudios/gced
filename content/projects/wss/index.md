I helped Mid-Kansas Ear, Nose and Throat Associates create a light weight WordPress theme to showcase their talents. Built on Foundation 5 they actually generate a lot of traffic, so it's important that they implement JavaScript and CSS that help users navigate and find what they're looking for quickly and easily. I've worked with Wichita Surgical Specialists, P.A. to create various websites that work  or both users while helping bolster Search Engine Ranking Position.

Check it out and see for yourself and see how the various page templates are dramatically different. Utilizing Custom Post types I allow for users to easily add, edit and update profiles for both physicians and assistants. You can see that the physicians pages are well styled. When working on a project like this, it's a joy to find creative solutions to what clients want, and Zurb does an  excellent job helping designers and developers both achieve these needs with minimal code markup.
