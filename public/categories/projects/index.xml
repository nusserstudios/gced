      <description>I really did try to push for a concept and the 5 star showing the end of shells turned out fantastic. It never did get printed or ran, but I kept this project, because it showcases great art and copy.</description>

      <description>I help companies small and large build brands. Some are a branded houses, but Mears is a House of Brands. They package fertilizer, and ice-melt for companies of all different sizes. So I&amp;rsquo;ve helped them with not only their company branding and identity, I&amp;rsquo;ve also helped them create many brands that are specific to them.</description>
